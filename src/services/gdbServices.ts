 *   await db.map({ query: { type: 'poll' } }, ({ id, value, action }) => { ... });

 *     superadmin. `delete` is granted but ALWAYS scoped by node-level ACLs (below),
 *     so there is no global censor that can erase another's content platform-wide.
 *  2. Node-level ACLs (`acls: true`) make each post an owned node (author = owner):
 *     an author deletes their OWN posts, and a community owner can delegate `delete`
 *     to trusted moderators, who then remove content in THAT community only. Removal
 *     is community-scoped, never central.
 *
 * `guest` is open (write+link) so anyone participates the moment they exist.
 * `member` and `trusted` are reputation tiers the governance engine grants and
 * revokes. `superadmin` is the governance signer/notary: it signs only the role
 * changes the public rules dictate, and it must be online merely to GRANT a
 * promotion — once signed, the role becomes synced graph state and propagates and
 * persists across peers even after the superadmin goes offline.
